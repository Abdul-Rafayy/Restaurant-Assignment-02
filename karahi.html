    <h1 class="karahi">Karahi:</h1>
    <p class="karahi">Karahi, also known as kadai or kadhai, refers to both a type of cooking utensil and the dishes prepared using that utensil. In South Asian and Central Asian cuisine, a karahi is a deep, circular, and wok-like cooking pan made of cast iron or other materials. It has two handles on the sides and is commonly used for deep-frying, stir-frying, and simmering. <br><br>

        Additionally, dishes prepared in a karahi are often named after the utensil itself. Karahi dishes are popular in Indian, Pakistani, and Afghan cuisines. These dishes are characterized by a rich and flavorful preparation method, often involving a mix of spices and ingredients. <br><br>
        
        Common examples of karahi dishes include: <br>
        
        1.Chicken Karahi: Chicken cooked in the karahi with a blend of spices, tomatoes, green chilies, and coriander. <br>
        
        2.Lamb Karahi: Similar to chicken karahi but with lamb as the main protein. <br>
        
        3.Vegetable Karahi: A vegetarian version, often featuring a mix of fresh vegetables cooked in the karahi with spices. <br>
        
        4.Prawn Karahi: Involves prawns or shrimp cooked with the characteristic karahi spices. <br></p>
