    <h1 class="handi">Handi:</h1>
    <p class="handi">"Handi" refers to both a traditional cooking vessel and the dishes prepared using this utensil. In South Asian cuisine, a handi is a deep, narrow-necked, and round-bellied cooking pot, usually made of clay, brass, or copper. The design of the handi allows for slow cooking and simmering, which is ideal for developing rich and aromatic flavors in traditional dishes. <br><br>

        Additionally, dishes cooked in a handi are often named after the utensil itself. Handi dishes are popular in Indian, Pakistani, and other South Asian cuisines. These dishes are known for their slow-cooked nature, which allows the flavors to meld and intensify. <br><br>
        
        Common examples of handi dishes include: <br>
        
        1.Chicken Handi: Tender chicken pieces cooked in a handi with a blend of spices, tomatoes, cream, and sometimes yogurt. <br>
        
        2.Lamb Handi: Similar to chicken handi but featuring lamb as the main protein. <br>
        
        3.Vegetable Handi: A vegetarian version, often including a mix of vegetables cooked in the handi with aromatic spices. <br>
        
        4.Paneer Handi: Involves paneer (Indian cottage cheese) cooked in the handi with a flavorful combination of spices and herbs. <br></p>
