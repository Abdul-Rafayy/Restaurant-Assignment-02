    <h1 class="steak">Steaks:</h1>
    <p class="steak">Steaks are cuts of meat, usually beef, that are known for their tenderness and flavor. The quality of a steak can be influenced by factors such as the cut of meat, the grade of beef, and how it's cooked. <br><br>

        Here are some popular cuts of steak: <br><br>
        
        1.Ribeye: Known for its rich marbling, the ribeye is a flavorful and tender cut that comes from the rib section. <br>
        
        2.Filet Mignon: This is a lean and tender cut, known for its buttery texture. It's taken from the smaller end of the tenderloin. <br>
        
        3.New York Strip: Also known as the strip steak, it's a well-marbled and flavorful cut that comes from the short loin. <br>
        
        4.T-Bone: This steak includes a T-shaped bone and has meat on both sides â€“ a tenderloin on one side and a strip steak on the other. <br>
        
        5.Sirloin: This cut is less tender than some others but is known for its beefy flavor. It's usually more affordable. <br>
        
        6.Flank Steak: A lean and flavorful cut that benefits from marinating. It's often used in fajitas and stir-fries. <br><br>
        
        When cooking steaks, popular methods include grilling, pan-searing, or broiling. The level of doneness (rare, medium-rare, medium, medium-well, or well-done) is a matter of personal preference. <br><br>
        
        Remember to let the steaks rest for a few minutes after cooking to allow the juices to redistribute, ensuring a juicy and flavorful result. Additionally, seasoning with salt and pepper is a simple yet effective way to enhance the natural flavors of the meat.
