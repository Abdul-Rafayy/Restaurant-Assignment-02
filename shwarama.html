    <h1 class="shawarma">Shwarama:</h1>
    <p class="shawarma">Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish made of thinly sliced cuts of meat, such as lamb, chicken, turkey, beef, or a mixture of these meats. The meat is often seasoned with a blend of spices, including garlic, cumin, coriander, and paprika, and then stacked on a vertical rotisserie. As it cooks, the outer layer gets crispy, and the inner layers remain moist and flavorful. <br><br>

        The cooked meat is typically shaved off the vertical rotisserie and served in a flatbread or pita, often accompanied by a variety of toppings and sauces. Common toppings include tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and lettuce, while popular sauces include tahini, garlic sauce, hummus, or yogurt-based dressings. <br><br>
        
        Shawarma is a street food favorite and is enjoyed in many parts of the world. It's known for its delicious blend of spices and the contrast between the crispy outer layer and the tender inner meat. The style and specific ingredients can vary based on regional preferences and cultural influences. <br><br>
